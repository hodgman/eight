# WORK IN PROGRESS

This project contains many core classes/functions from the "Eight" game engine, including: efficient memory allocators, multi-core structures, asynchronous asset loading, debug helpers, message-passing, unit testing, and a lightweight Lua binding system.

Higher level parts of the engine, such as the toolchain or rendering systems are not published here.
